			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>Ray's Clothiers started as a small neighbourhood stall with a simple idea: clothing should feel good, look good, and last. We partner with ethical mills and select timeless fabrics so each piece works hard in your wardrobe. Over the years we grew into a small team focused on responsible production and clear pricing.</p>

			<h3>Craft & Materials</h3>
			<p>We choose natural fibres and durable weaves, prioritising comfort and longevity. Our product team tests fabrics for fit and wear so that every collection improves season after season.</p>
